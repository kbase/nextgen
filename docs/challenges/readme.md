# KBase Challenges

This directory contains documents describing current challenges within KBase.

Due to its flexilibility and ability to render nicely as a real document, we are using (or at least trying) [AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) as the text format for these documents. Note that GitHub also natively understands AsciiDoc and therefore should be able to render the pages for browsing.

The top-level document, `challenges.txt`, includes all the other documents.
