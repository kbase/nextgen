DevOps Challenges

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~

Heavy deployment:: Services currently use a full virtual machine

Difficult to allow developers to deploy their own mini-KBase for development purposes:: For example, narrative can be deployed locally, but services that a local deployment depends on are much harder

Parallel deployment:: We want to be able to deploy the next version of a module without disrupting the current version, then run tests against the new deployment, then promote the new version only if tests pass

Testing
~~~~~~~

Would like a process to populate dev environments with enough test data to be useful:: Probably should be done by service developers?
